# ChatterBot Setup Error Documentation

This document provides a detailed analysis of the errors encountered while setting up and running **ChatterBot** in a Python virtual environment, along with their causes and resolutions.

## 1. Pip Dependency Resolver Warning

**Error:**
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. 
This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
chatterbot 1.0.4 requires sqlalchemy<1.3,>=1.2, but you have sqlalchemy 1.3.24
```

**Cause:**  
ChatterBot 1.0.4 requires an older version of `sqlalchemy` (`>=1.2, <1.3`). The installed version (`1.3.24`) was incompatible.

**Fix:**  
Downgrade `sqlalchemy` to a supported version:
```bash
pip install sqlalchemy==1.2.19
```

## 2. `time.clock` AttributeError

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'
```

**Cause:**  
Python 3.8+ removed `time.clock()`. However, ChatterBotâ€™s dependency (`sqlalchemy`) still referenced it, leading to an error.

**Fix:**  
Manually patched the code to use modern functions:
```python
if win32 or jython:
    time_func = time.perf_counter   # replaced time.clock
else:
    time_func = time.time
```

## 3. NLTK `punkt_tab` LookupError

**Error:**
```
LookupError: 
  Resource punkt_tab not found.
  Please use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:
  >>> import nltk
  >>> nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

**Cause:**  
NLTK recently split the `punkt` tokenizer into two resources: `punkt` and `punkt_tab`. ChatterBot requires both, but only `punkt` was downloaded by default.

**Fix:**  
Download the required resources:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

---

## âœ… Final Result

After applying the above fixes:
- Dependencies are aligned (`sqlalchemy` downgraded).  
- Legacy code updated (`time.clock` replaced).  
- NLTK resources installed (`punkt`, `punkt_tab`, `stopwords`).  

The **ChatterBot project runs successfully** without errors ðŸŽ‰

## Notes
- These errors are common when using **ChatterBot** with newer versions of Python and libraries.  
- Future developers should maintain a `requirements.txt` file to lock dependency versions for stability.
